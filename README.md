# Minigrep
Following the Rust Book (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html).
However, instead of using `clone` to parse the arguments, I implemented lifetimes.

## Use
After installing using `cargo install`, you can access it in the terminal with `minigrep [string-to-search] [filename]`
For example, `minigrep hello hello-world.txt`
